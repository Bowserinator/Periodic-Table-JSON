# Periodic-Table-JSON
A json of the entire periodic table. Feel free to use it in your projects.

Temperatures such as boiling points and melting points are given in Kelvin.  Densities are given in g/l for gases and g/cmÂ³ for solids and liquids and molar heat in (mol*K).
Information that is missing is represented as null. Some elements may have an image link to their spectral bands.

All elements have a three sentence summary from Wikipedia.

**Electron configuration** is given as a string, with each orbital separated by a space.  **Electron configuration semantic** is given as a string, this is the short-hand version of the electron configuration. Elements with a semantic electron configuration marked with a "*" mean that the electron configuration has not yet been confirmed. **Electron shells** are given as an array, the first item is the number of electrons in the first shell, the 2nd item is the number of electrons in the second shell, and so on.

Both **ionization energy** and **first electron affinities** are given as the energy required to *detach* an electron from the anion.  Ionization energies are given as an array for successive ionization energy.

A link to the source where the information was from is provided in each element under the key "source".

A link to image Bohr model (of the atom) is available under "bohr_model_image" key.
A link to 3d-image of Bohr model available under "bohr_model_3d" key, file obtained from google with ```.glb``` extention and these 3d models can easily display on web using [google model-viewer script](https://modelviewer.dev/)

Here's an example of how it's formatted:

## Additional Formats

Besides the original JSON file `PeriodicTableJSON.json`, the data is provided in the following additional formats:

- As a lookup table for easy indexing in `periodic-table-lookup.json`.

- As a CSV file (one row per element and one column per property, where some subfields are flattened to strings) in `periodicTableCSV.csv`.

These files are generated from the original data via scripts in the directory `scripts`.
